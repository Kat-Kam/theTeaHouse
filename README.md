# the tea house

This is the code for my UX case study, the online shop "the tea house". The task was to design and code it, but my university's assignment required a later deviation from the original design. The special features implemented here (e.g. that you can order the 2nd product only once) were part of the task and can be gradually transformed into a meaningful userflow. All images are taken from Unsplash with many thanks to the artists.

The orders are stored in local memory and are deleted as soon as they are removed from the shopping cart. 
Local storage works best with Chrome and Visual Studio Code's live server, others have not worked reliably in the past.
