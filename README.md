# the tea house

This is the code for my UX case study, the online store "The Teahouse". During the implementation only some features of the design were realized and others were implemented according to the university's specification (e.g. that you can order the 2nd product only once, the design of the buttons with shadows). All images are from Unsplash, many thanks to the artists.

Orders are stored in local storage and deleted as soon as they are removed from the shopping cart. Local storage works best with Chrome and Visual Studio Code's live server. With other browsers or without a live server, the application has not worked reliably in the past.
