            Bancha. This is the type of tea on which the tea is based.
            Unlike other green teas, it has a calming effect with its low caffeine content.
            Especially with a nervous stomach, you make the right choice, because it has a particularly calming effect due to the high proportion of tannins.

            <h1>Good to know</h1>
            <p>
              The origin of green tea is in China.
              There it has been cultivated since the 6th century BC in different varieties and forms.
              In the following centuries, green tea also spread to Japan and India, where the production, processing and preparation were further refined.
              Today there are over 50 different species, most of which are grown in Asia.
              Our green tea, on the other hand, comes from Kenya.
              This is rather unusual, as Kenya is actually known for its black tea.
              If you want to know more about the origin of our tea, just scroll down a bit ;D

              <p>
                Tunaifanya kuwa bora zaidi! That means “we can do better!”
                This is the goal of the founder Malaika Juma.
                Together with her 19-year-old son Kito and 7 employees, she runs a small Bancha plantation in Saosa.
                In Kenya, tea is mainly produced via the so-called CTC production.
                The tea is first wrought, then rolled and then torn by rolling.
                For example, standard tea for tea bags is produced quickly and mechanically.
                Malaika has set itself the goal not to support this crude and often wasteful method.
                That’s why she processes her tea like in the Song Dynasty.
                The tea is first steamed and dried over several weeks.
              It is then ground with stone mills to a coarse powder.
              Despite the company’s small greetings, she was able to earn a very good reputation thanks to local awards.

                  Kanduyi Children e. V. supports socially disadvantaged children and young people in Kenya by financing further education.
