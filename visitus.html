        <p class="about-p-position">
          Teacup is a modern company with a rich history in the field of tea.
          As children of a tea producer, the owners of Teacup grew up between tea leaves, so to speak.
          Since 1998, Teacup has been realizing the ideal of high-quality tea without compromising the environment.
          Our blends are composed by experienced tea sommeliers and contain ingredients of the highest quality.
          <br />
          <br />
          But teacup is more than just tea.
          It is a lifestyle that stands for enjoyment, healthy choices, love for oneself, for others and for the planet.
          All these things together make you happy.
          And happy people who are healthy and comfortable make the world a little more beautiful.
          The teas from tastea are suitable for a healthy lifestyle.
          We use ingredients that can help you lose weight, relax or just get through the day with a little more energy.

        <p class="about-p-position">
          Since our goal is to provide you with a completely climate-neutral tea, a kind of ecological backpack is charged for each tea pack.
          This includes all products including their manufacture, use and disposal.
          For the transport of lorries, not only the fuel is taken into account, but also the lorry plant and the road network.
          We balance out the complete ecological backpack.
          We also want to pay our suppliers fair prices so that the production is worthwhile for them too.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to the actual product costs, 22% of each package goes to an environmental or social project in the respective country of production.
          We work closely with our partner
          <a class="about-text-link" href="https://www.betterplace.org/de"> betterplace</a>.
          A little further down you will also find a graphical representation of the price composition.
